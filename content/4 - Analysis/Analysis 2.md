# Document Study

From the [[Analysis 1|document]], a reader can learn the different types of listening and hearing a person can partake in. The document informs the reader of variants of listening, the processes of listening, the obstacles in listening, and the types of non-listening. 

## Types of listening

There are a variety of different listening styles a person can use. Listening can be influenced by what the person choses to hear. Being good or bad information can sway the way a person listens to what they hear. And who or what they listen to can influence, being from a source they like or dislike can also influence their opinion.

## The listening process

The listening process involves the steps to being a good listener. 
* Being mindful to the source of sound. 
* Physically reacting to the sound. 
* Choosing what to react to
* Interpreting what the source says
* Responding to the sound
* Remembering the sounds made

## Listening and gender

Gender plays a role in the influence of how we respond to sound. From a person who does not respect the gender of the person speaking, they can choose to not listen or respond in a negative way. The gender of a speaker can change the way a person reacts to the information and can influence the way they listen.

## Obstacles to effective listening

There are many obstacles that can prevent a person from really listening to sound. Some people can be overloaded by noise and be overwhelmed by information. Some sounds can be too or overly complex for a person to understand. Some environments can hinder a person's ability to listen well. Some people have other tasks going on preventing their full focus on the sound. Some people have prejudgments on the source of the sound, influencing their opinion. Some don't even care enough to listen. And some don't care to accommodate those with other cultures or rules in conversation.

## Types of non-listening

There are many types of styles a person can use to not listen to others:
* **Pseudo listening**: a style where one pretends to listen to the other.
* **Monopolizing**: Where one dominates the conversation and the attention.
* **Selective listening**: When one chooses to focus on only certain parts.
* **Defensive listening**: Listening to only to what they think are personal attacks.
* **Ambushing**: Listening for the purpose of attacking another person.
* **Literal listening**: Listening only for the content, not the relationship.

## Effective listening techniques

To become a more effective listener a person can practice these tips:
