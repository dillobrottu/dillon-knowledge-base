# Hearing in conversations

To have a conversation is to make sound and have a person [[content/1 - Hearing/index|hear]] in the sound that you make. Your voice creates waves in the air that enters into another person's ears for them to process. But to only hear what a person says can have a different outcome than to listen.

## Only hearing

When a person hears what they say, they acknowledge their conversation between them, but only to acknowledge them. When a person decides to only hear what they say, some of the information can be lost to anyone participating in the conversation.

Some examples of a person only hearing what is said can be seen in debates where a person does not care about what the other has to say and is only there to talk to the other person or an audience.
### Why a person only decides to hear

In a simple conversation a person can move easier if a person hears the words another person says and quickly processes their words to move on from what they say. As said before, a person can refuse to understand what the other is saying as a move of dominance or uncaring notion. To not acknowledge the other person's words and to only talk can influence other people's opinion of you and to give your words a different feeling.

In [[Hearing 4|other]] forms of hearing a person can decide to partake in, a person can decide the [[Hearing 5|reason]] for why they hear.
